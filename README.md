# IAT360_FINAL_PROJECT
Our goal in this project is to address the CEWIL prompt of how data, storytelling, and public art can help communities envision and shape their climate future. Our project concept is to promote conversations surrounding important climate issues by making a chatbot that returns concise discussions related to the input topic

Misinformation regarding climate concerns affects how communities view and take action toward these problems. A chatbot that delivers these topics in a quick, comprehensible way is a solution to this and encourages future actions to remedy current environmental issues. This chatbot would be useful to anyone who is unsure about any kind of climate issue and wants a quick understanding of some current conversations surrounding it.
